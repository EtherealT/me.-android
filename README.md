## About
Me. is a self management app I'm building partly for my personal use and the learning experience, 
but mostly for fun. I have plans for a web interface as well, but that's a little down the line.
    
    
## Features
* Inspirational Quotes
* Journal -- planned
* Task Manager -- planned
* Finance Manager -- planned
* Password Manager -- planned
    
    
## Installation / Running
As of now, there is no functional release version as I'm still in the early stages of development but if you are interested in building the app:
* You should have the [Android SDK](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html) installed
* You should also have [Gradle](https://gradle.org) installed
* To build: ```gradle assembleDebug``` or ```gradle installDebug``` to build and install immediately on an emulator or connected device
* To run tests: ```gradle connectedAndroidTest```
